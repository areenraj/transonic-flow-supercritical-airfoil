# Transonic Flow over a Super Critical Airfoil

## Introduction

Supersonic travel has always been an topic of particularly challeneging difficulty in the aviation industry. The flow is extremely difficult to harness and counter as it is plagued by discontinuous shocks, oscillating phenomena and huge levels of drag. This problem took on such an infamous form that early venturings into the field led to the coining of the term the "sound barrier" because the task was deemed impossible at the time. Much of the conundrum involved in the problem is due to the presence of large shocks that develop on the wing which lead to a sudden increase in the overall drag by manipulation of the pressure field around the airfoil. This is termed as wave drag. 

The pressure after the shock exhibits a discontinuous jump which causes the flow to separate in view of the sudden and extreme pressure gradient. This futher increases the pressure drag even more. The freestream flow does not need to be supersonic for this to happen. Every airfoil has a particular Mach No. for which the drag spikes suddenly as the flow climbs across the airfoil and increases in velocity and becomes locally supersonic. The Mach No. at which the drag suddenly spikes is called the drag divergence Mach No. This regime of flow is called transonic as both subsonic and supersonic elements exist in the flow. 

## Super Critical Airfoils

Whitcomb, in his time at NASA (known as NACA at that point), worked on the supersonic problem to counter the high drag induced in aircraft. His approach was to develop an airfoil which would have a flatter suction section where the flow wouldn't accelerate. This causes the flow to reach the supersonic point farther down the wing. Also, the bottom part of the foil is more curved to induce an inverted normal shock - thus increasing lift. This concentrates the lift at the back portion of the
